Inspiration
School chromebooks have a lot of restrictions. NovaHaven = no more restrictions on web. Developed by students, maintained by students, and distributed to students. All search options will hide history.

How 2 Use
You must type in the entire URL. Certain buttons pressed will let you in on certain insights. The home button on the upper right will return you back to the home page.

Sites that work
Unfortunately, there are not many sites that will actually work with the current search options. Only educational sites and not games (not sure how to unblock them successfully with my current proxy) will be able to be unblocked.

Search Method 1: IFrame
This method has become degraded and no longer works effectively as of 10/22/19. Securly is able to block websites even in virtual containers like iframes. In addition, modern sites have protection against thrid parties attempting to take data.

Search Method 2: Object/Embed
This method has become degraded and no longer works effectively as of 10/22/19. Securly is able to block websites even in virtual containers like loading object data. In addition, modern sites have protection against thrid parties attempting to take data.

Search Method 3: IFrame + Sandbox
This method has become degraded and no longer works effectively as of 10/22/19. Securly is able to block websites even in virtual containers like loading object data. In addition, modern sites have protection against thrid parties attempting to take data. This IFrame is able to block popups.

Search Method 4: Proxy
Fail proof and almost always will work. However, styling of a webpage is often lost. However, interactivity with sites are often lost.

Search Method 5: PDF Download
This method takes a long time but will most likely work. It will generate a pdf download of the site you wish to use, saving all links to use for proxy methods in the future.
